## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

1. **Review before delete**

   - Check how many products will be deleted
   - Check if batch status is FAILED/PARTIAL

2. **Use "Delete Batch Only" for audit trail**

   - Keep history for compliance
   - Products already in production

3. **Use "Delete Batch + Products" for cleanup**

   - Test uploads
   - Duplicate data
   - Invalid imports

4. **Check orders first**
   - Don't try to delete products that are ordered
   - System will block, but manual check is better

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Don't delete production batches without backup**
2. **Don't force delete products in orders**
3. **Don't spam delete (rate limiter)**
